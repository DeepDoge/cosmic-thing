**Not finished**

Bigger than visible universe space game like thingy, no loading screens, no tricks, every star you see is a real one.

Made with [Friflo.Engine.ECS](https://github.com/friflo/Friflo.Engine.ECS), OpenGL, and lots of custom systems, using "High-Performance" C# code with no GC. No dynamic allocation. O(1) generation without memory allocation, with pure functions that can scale and run in parallel.
