**Not finished yet**

A space game thingy that’s bigger than the visible universe. No loading screens, no hacks — every star you see is actually there.

Made with [Friflo.Engine.ECS](https://github.com/friflo/Friflo.Engine.ECS), OpenGL, and a bunch of custom systems. It’s all "High-Performance" C# with no GC — zero dynamic allocations. O(1) world generation with 0 heap allocation, and pure functions that scale and run in parallel. No empty checks, so generation doesn’t miss anything — no waste, whether it’s rendering or simulation updates.

Keep it stupid simple.

It’s a remake of:
- [Unity Space Game Template Prototype/Experiment Project Thingy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyjfxaAUsTI)  
- [Experiment Space "Thingy" #Devlog 2 | Unity DOTS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0wng5QbfKE)
